**Notes** :

> It is important to remember that the code provided is only an example and may vary depending on the specific needs and preferences of each project. Each developer and team has their own methods and practices for structuring and configuring an Express application.

> In the code, EJS is used as a templating engine to render the views, but it is important to note that this is only one option. You don't need to use EJS; You can opt for simple HTML if you wish. The choice of templating engine depends on the project requirements and the preferences of the development team.

> Additionally, middleware that handles requests not matching the routes defined above to respond with a 404 error page is common practice, but it is not the only way to handle errors in Express. There are different approaches to handling errors, and the choice depends on the complexity of the application and the specific needs of the project.

> In summary, the code provided is an example only and can be modified and adapted as necessary to meet the project requirements and the development team's preferences. The important thing is to choose the solution that best suits the needs of the project and guarantee an optimal user experience.
